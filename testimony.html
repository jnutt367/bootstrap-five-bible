        <h2 class="testimony">My Testimony: Breaking Free, Building Hope</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">In the echoes of Revelation, a voice proclaimed, "Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say: 'Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God"... These words, a beacon of hope, resonate with my journey.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I am Jason Nutt. Once, I was deeply entrenched in the throes of alcoholism, a life riddled with lies and self-indulgence. I wore the cloak of irresponsibility, blinding myself to my duties. I frequented rehab, a carousel of failed attempts until, by the grace of the Holy Spirit, I found redemption.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Transformed, I embraced a new purpose. Nearly 5 years ago now, I embarked on a path of learning—coding, crafting apps, and websites. </p>
            
            <p class="paragraph">Today, through divine guidance and tireless dedication, I've birthed a Bible application. Every word meticulously transcribed, each book coded, all freely available worldwide, devoid of advertisements.</p>
      
        <p class="paragraph">I pray for understanding, Lord, that every task You set forth deserves its reward. Your word, a steadfast promise, echoes in my heart. I stand firm, trusting in Your provision, believing that this app, meant to spread Your word freely, will receive the sustenance it needs.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">I humbly ask for Your provision, Lord, through free-will offerings, turning the hearts of Your followers toward this passion project. May this app flourish, a vessel akin to Noah's ark—a beacon of Your word.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Grateful for Your grace, I implore those touched by this mission to join the journey. The app, a testament to Your spirit within me, progresses from humble origins to its current form.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Witness the evolution, a testament to perseverance inspired by Your divine guidance.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Once lost in the depths of alcoholism, self-pity, and spiritual turmoil, I am now found in the grace of Jesus. His life, death, and resurrection have transformed me, saved by the enduring power of God's Holy Spirit.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This app stands as a testament, coded, published, and deployed by Your servant: Jason Daniel Nutt.</p>
        <p class="glory">"All glory to GOD, who is able, through His mighty power at work within us, to accomplish infinitely more than we ask or imagine" Ephesians 3:20</p>
